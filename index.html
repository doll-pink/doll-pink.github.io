        My email is doll@doll.pink you can contact me there incase i lose access to my social media.
    </p>
    <p style="color: black;">
        first of all before i go any further i gotta thank the beautiful souls that read my past posts and helped me out financially or even shared my situation. this also goes to future people that clicked this post and decided to read it so even if you dont make it till the end i thank you for considering to check this post out and i mean that...
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        i am looking for people to talk to since i have no one... i experience daily bullying by the very friendly country i was mislead to... thinking it was progressive my ass anyways i had to fly away from my family because they are abusive as hell and i have no idea what im doing
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        pretty sure there are some people irl that are stalking me to drive me insane or something... i have expirienced such stalking that was undeniable... online atleast... creepy messages and stuff.. but im starting to think its manifesting irl i got a death threat yesterday...
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        life is pretty hard being alone and knowing no one.. im pretty much treated like a t*rrorist and have dealt with racist comments ever since i came here.... ive lost a lot of people i knew and used to trust in,,, they turned out to be snakes... and have really no support group... everyone looking at me like im some sort of freak or something. real weird shit makes no sense.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        for all my life ive dealt with being outcasted and bullied for whatever reason... i was recently denied service by a mom and pop grocery store they said they will call the police apparently i scared them just by being there. everyone is so unfriendly and i used to think it was just my country... and that there is a greener side at the other end.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        but tbh this sort of behavior has increased tenfold ever since i came here and it seems to be getting worse... my energy keeps running out every day and im scared ill give up... my body is kinda healing ive been using all sort of creams they burn like hell but it seems to be working my skin is getting less dry for those who dont know my parents literally b*rned me with boiling water and other stuff without getting too graphic..
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        i also was homeless for the majority of the time i was here... i was basically treated like a thrown out soda can... people were acting as if i was not there... police harassed me too and i heard one of the police guys laugh once i spoke... i only got a hotel room and actual edible food after i made that fundraiser post after one of my friends suggested i do that...
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        i went to a shelter nearby but the people there were hostile to me stole my stuff etc... so i just decided to sleep somewhere else outside... i slept on a rooftop of a building for most days... with cardboard as a blanket.. my hands were literally turned into stone... i couldnt feel them i was dehydrated hungry and in a confused haze kinda state... i still am... this whole thing has affected me a lot and i think its gonna permanent or at least long lasting....

        Hi everyone, I'm Layla 22 years old trans woman from Egypt. I'm now living in Germany on a temporary visa which has expired 5 days now, trying to get asylum/housing etc after barely escaping my family
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        They chained me naked to a bed for hours without food or water, beat me with a belt, and told me they would report me to police. they abused me sexually with household tools as a form of "correction,"
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        They burned cigarettes on my body, filmed me begging for mercy.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        Poured boiling oil on my legs starved me for weeks, forced bleach down my throat.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        I've tried applying for asylum 20+ days ago but they denied it for insufficient proof... apparently showing them my scars isnt enough... its hard to do all this alone... my legs hurt from the burns... walking is like hell i feel like a zombie i don't even know what is happening anymore...
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        I don't know if i should keep trying to apply or give up.... If you have any insight as to what i should do please contact me at my reddit
    </p>

    <p style="color: black;">
        I need help with Legal fees for a Lawyer to build my case with scar photos, HRT records, scar care, dental repair, and medical reports proving persecution. Everyday essentials like groceries, transit passes and a place to stay for the time being. (I'm currently living in a hotel.. after being homeless for nearly a month)
